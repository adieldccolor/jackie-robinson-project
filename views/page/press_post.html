				<p>
					<br>
					NEW YORK, NY (September 3, 2014) – Della Britton Baeza, President and CEO of the Jackie Robinson 
					<br><br>
					Foundation (JRF), announced the recent appointment of Josh Balber as the Foundation’s new Communications Director. After fifteen years of communications leadership in the publishing, nonprofit arts and education sectors in the New York metropolitan area, Balber joins the Foundation, which is recognized for being the nation’s premier education and leadership development scholarship program for minority students. 
					 <br><br>
					“Josh’s familiarity with deadline-driven, multi-channel communications, combined with his expertise with the nonprofit, education and general media will be of tremendous benefit to the organization,” said Ms. Britton. “His stewardship of both internal and external communications for JRF will include a host of new ideas on how to more strongly engage various constituents and expand the visibility of the foundation.” 
					 <br><br>
					Balber spent a decade at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC), one of the country’s top ten performing arts centers, most recently as its Assistant Vice President of Communications overseeing external, internal, executive leadership and government communications. He raised the institution’s profile nationally and regionally – spotlighting throughout all media hundreds of special events and performances each season as well as philanthropic, educational and real estate initiatives– and was a primary liaison with local and state government officials and the arts and culture lobby. Notable among his personal engagements, Mr. Balber serves on the board of directors forGlassRoots, a nonprofit that supports underserved youth through a rigorous education program using glass-making to teach marketing and entrepreneurship skills and creative self-expression. Prior to NJPAC, Mr. Balber was an account executive at a boutique New York public relations agency, representing publishing and business clients in national and online publicity campaigns. He has a B.S. in Political Science and Film Studies from Washington University in St. Louis.

					Conjuring up Jackie Robinson’s guiding principle that “a life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives,” Balber remarked, “I am excited to help promote the tremendous impact that the Foundation has had on over 1,450 young people, myriad supporters and partners, and ultimately on immeasurable communities around the country and the world. It’s an honor to work for the foundation that was established by such an iconic, history-changing family to perpetuate the legacy of American hero Jackie Robinson with a long, successful track record of effecting change through the activation of its important mission.”
